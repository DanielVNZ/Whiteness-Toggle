This mod allows you to toggle whiteness when placing objects as well as changing this to a custom colour of your choosing.

**How To Use:**
Key binding: Shift + W (default) - Can be changed in settings. 

**Note: If you have an Info View open, must close/open to take effect.**

**Settings Options Explained:**
* **Disable Whiteness** - Use this to disable Whiteness, can also be done with Shift + W 
* **Use Custom Overlay** - Use this to enable a custom Overlay using the sliders below or the colour blind settings. 
* **The Sliders** - For optimal use keep the slider values low
