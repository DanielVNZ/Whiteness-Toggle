This mod allows you to toggle whiteness when placing objects as well as change this to a custom colour of your choosing.

# How To Use:
**Key bind:** Shift + W

Please note that once whiteness is off, you'll need to click on a different menu for it to update.

# Settings Options Explained:
**Disable Whiteness** - Use this to disable Whiteness, can also be done with Shift + W
**Use Custom Overlay** - Use this to enable a custom Overlay using the sliders below or the colour blind settings.
**The Sliders** - For optimal use keep the slider values low
**Colour Blindness Options** - These are NOT correct, feedback is welcome and encouraged!

**Q: Why have I made this mod when its included in Legacy Flavor?**
**A:** As legacy flavor conflicts with assets currently and the creator is no longer providing fixes for it (besides patch updates). If this ever gets fixed, this mod may be removed (unless there is interest with it being a standalone mod.)

# Credits:
* Credit To **Optimus_Code** - Legacy Flavor.
* Credit to **Nyoko** for help with key binds and Logo Creation.

# Roadmap:
* Implement custom key binds.
