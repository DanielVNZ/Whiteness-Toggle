	<LongDescription>
		A simple mod to toggle the Whiteness screen when placing objects.

		How To Use:

		Keybind: Shift + W
		Currently I dont know a way to make this easially changable, if the keybind conflicts with anything, please let me know.

		When pressing the above keybind it toggles between whiteness on/off. Please note that once whiteness is off, youll need to click on a different menu for it to update.
		As this replaces the Legacy Flavour keybind, this is NOT COMPATIBLE with Legacy Flavour!
		
		Q: Why have I made this mod when its included in Legacy Flavour?
		A: As legacy flavor conflicts with assets currently and the creator is no longer providing fixes for it (besides patch updates). If this ever gets fixed, this mod may be removed (unless there is interest with it being a standalone mod.)

		* Credit to Nyoko for help with keybinds.
