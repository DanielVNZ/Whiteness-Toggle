# NOTE: Keybind has CHANGED to SHIFT + E by default. SHIFT + W is now a vanilla key bind for the fast camera movement. You can still change the keybind in settings though!

This mod allows you to toggle whiteness when placing objects as well as changing this to a custom colour of your choosing.
How To Use:

Key binding: **Shift + E** (default) - Can be changed in settings

**Note: If you have an Info View open, must close/open to take effect**

# Settings Options Explained:

**Disable Whiteness** - Use this to disable Whiteness, can also be done with Shift + W

**Use Custom Overlay** - Use this to enable a custom Overlay using the sliders below or the colour blind settings.

**The Sliders** - For optimal use keep the slider values low

**Colour Blindness Options** - These are NOT correct, feedback is welcome and encouraged!
